# FOSSGIS - Session 1

Session 1 of the FOSSGIS Seminar WS 2019/20

## Setting up your computer for the course

## Windows

### OSGeo Programs 

On Windows, most software we need can be installed using the OSGeo Installer. Download the OSGeo Installer from [here](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/).

Start the Installer and choose __"Advanced Installation"__. All other settings can be left at the default value.

When you are presented with a list of packages, select the following ones to be installed: __Make sure to select the correct versions!__ 

- qgis: QGIS Desktop 3.8.3-1
- grass: GRASS GIS   7.6.1-1
- saga-ltr: SAGA 2.3.2-4
- gdal: The GDAL/OGR library and command line tools 2.4.1-1
- python3-core 3.7.0-3
- qgis-grass-plugin7: GRASS7 plugin for QGIS 3.8.3-1

All necessary dependencies are selected automatically.

After installation all OSGEO programs (e.g. gdal, ogr) are available from within the OSGEO4W shell. 

### git 
Windows does not automatically come with a git installation. Therefore, download "git for Windows" from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it. After installation you can you git from the normal Windows command line (Eingabeaufforderung).
